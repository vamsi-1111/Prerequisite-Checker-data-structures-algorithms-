# Prerequisite Checker (Data structures & Algorithms)

## Overview
Designed and implemented a program to verify student eligibility for courses at Rutgers by modeling course prerequisite requirements as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Utilized an adjacency list to efficiently store and traverse the graph, ensuring accurate and scalable verification of course prerequisites.

## Technologies Used
